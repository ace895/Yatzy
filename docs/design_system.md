This file is used to document the design choices we made to our yatzy game. 
The overall design we decide on was the keep it simple and minimalistic with only a few basic colors as our main focus was the game functionality.

## Fonts
- **Primary Font:** Segoe UI
- **Secondary Font** Sans Serif

## Colors
- **Primary Color:** #58C4D1
- **Secondary Color:** #F0DE55
- We chose a light blue color for the background and yellow for accents and buttons
- When hovering over a die or score box, they also have a shade of yellow
- We chose to keep simple, but contrasting colors to keep the design minimalistic but still interesting and appealing
